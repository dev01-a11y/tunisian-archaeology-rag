Mustis is the pseudonym of Øyvind Johan Mustaparta (born 10 September 1979), a Norwegian keyboardist best known for his work in the symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir, as well as the black/thrash metal band Susperia.

Biography
Mustis was briefly an official member of Susperia (at the time named Seven Sins) from 1999 to mid-2000. He played keyboards on a demo EP the band released called Illusions of Evil (2000), shortly after which he left the band to focus on Dimmu Borgir.
Mustis made his first appearance on a Dimmu Borgir release when he played keyboards on live tracks featured in the compilation album Godless Savage Garden (1998). He has contributed to the further progression of their ambient, atmospherical, symphonic sound. This can be heard in songs such as "Progenies of the Great Apocalypse", which he composed, from the album Death Cult Armageddon (2003). His other studio work with Dimmu Borgir includes Spiritual Black Dimensions (1999), Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia (2001), Death Cult Armageddon (2003), the re-release of Stormblåst (2005) and In Sorte Diaboli (2007).  
After departing the band in 2009, he issued a statement in which he implied that he was being kept out of the proper registration for music he was writing.  Likewise, according to his statement, he was fired by text message and he will be allowing "the resolution come from the lawyers instead of dealing with more dishonesty and lies on a one-on-one personal level".
In 2010, Mustis made a return to Susperia, providing keyboards and orchestral arrangements on the album We Are The Ones (2011). The lead single, "Nothing Remains", was entered into 2011's Eurovision Song Contest to represent Norway, but it was knocked out in the semi-final of the qualifying Melodi Grand Prix.
He has played keyboards as a session musician and appeared on singles by Art Of Departure and Lindsay Schoolcraft, respectively. In 2023, symphonic black metal band Odium welcomed Mustis as a member, after he joined them as second keyboardist for a performance at the Inferno Metal Festival. After 15 years, he reunited with Dimmu Borgir to perform "The Insight and the Catharsis" at the Inferno Metal Festival 2024, along with other former bandmates ICS Vortex and Tjodalv.
Mustis' surname Mustaparta comes from Finnish. Literally translated, it means 'black beard'.
